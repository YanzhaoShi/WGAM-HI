The sourse code about the weak labels.

file: 1-weak_label_generation.py
target: generate ground truth weak labels (frame weak labels and spatial weak labels)

file: 2-weak_label_prediction.py
target: predict weak labels (frame weak labels and spatial weak labels) by deep learning model

file: 3-weak_label_fitting.py
target: fit the predicted weak labels and ground truth labels by optimizing loss function
